correctly and the failure may go unnoticed. Security function is defined as the hardware,
software, and/or firmware of the information system responsible for enforcing the system
security policy and supporting the isolation of code and data on which the protection is
based. Security functionality includes, but is not limited to, establishing system
accounts, configuring access authorizations (i.e., permissions, privileges), setting
events to be audited, and setting intrusion detection parameters.

This requirement
applies to the Ubuntu operating system performing security function verification/testing
and/or systems and environments that require this functionality.'

Check that the AIDE package is installed with the following command:
     $ sudo dpkg -l | grep aide 
     ii   aide   0.16.1-1build2   amd64   Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment - static binary

If AIDE is not installed, ask the System Administrator how file integrity checks are performed on the system. 

If there is no application installed to perform integrity checks, this is a finding.

If AIDE is installed, check if it has been initialized with the following command:
     $ sudo aide.wrapper --check

If the output is "Couldn't open file /var/lib/aide/aide.db for reading", this is a finding.)

Install AIDE:
     $ sudo apt install aide

Initialize it (this may take a few minutes):
     $ sudo aideinit
